# halbtaxPLUS_calculator
Small script to calculate and estimate whether you should buy a HalbtaxPLUS or a GA for swiss public transport.

To run the script, replace the necessary information with your own routes/prices/travel frequencies and run the main_sbb.py file afterwards.

The output will be a plot showing your expected cost and a distribution that randomly samples simulated years according to the range of travel frequencies you filled in. This should give you an indication of how sure you can be that you'll stay below/above the GA threshold.
The script accounts for the cost of the HalbtaxPLUS as well as the different discounts you get by choosing one of the prepaid options.
